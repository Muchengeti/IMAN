After cloning the project do the following to run the projects backend and frontend

Before you get started, open two terminal tabs. One will be to run the sites backend server and the other the frontend server.

In The First Terminal:
1. From the root folder of the project, navigate to the backend ("IMAN/backend") 
2. Activate the virtual environment using the command "source env/bin/activate"
3. Once the virtual environment is activated change directory to the "src" folder.
4. Run the backend using the command "python manage.py runserver"

In The Second Terminal
1. From the root folder of the project folder, navigate to "IMAN/frontend/gui/src"
2. Run the backend using the command "npm start"

Once both processes are successfully running, access the site through "localhost:3000/home" in your browser.
You should be taken to a default homepage. To access event and article pages, simply navigate to them in the top navbar.
